								<h3>Water Scarcity,Risk and Vulnerability <small>Post on September 10th 2015</small></h3>

                            	Four voices from four countries united by a single
								theme: deprivation in access to water. That
								deprivation can be measured by statistics, but
								behind the numbers are the human faces of the
								millions of people denied an opportunity to realize
								their potential. Water, the stuff of life and a
								basic human right, is at the heart of a daily crisis
								faced by countless millions of the world’s most
								vulnerable people—a crisis that threatens life
								and destroys livelihoods on a devastating scale.
								Unlike wars and natural disasters, the
								global crisis in water does not make media
								headlines. Nor does it galvanize concerted international
								action. Like hunger, deprivation
								in access to water is a silent crisis experienced
								by the poor and tolerated by those with the resources,
								the technology and the political power
								to end it. Yet this is a crisis that is holding back
								human progress, consigning large segments of
								humanity to lives of poverty, vulnerability and
								insecurity. This crisis claims more lives through
								disease than any war claims through guns. It
								also reinforces the obscene inequalities in life
								chances that divide rich and poor nations in
								an increasingly prosperous and interconnected
								world and that divide people within countries
								on the basis of wealth, gender and other markers
								for disadvantage.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Scarcity</h4>
                            <p>
                            	“By means of water”, says the Koran, “we give life
								to everything.” That simple teaching captures a
								deeper wisdom. People need water as surely as
								they need oxygen: without it life could not exist.
								But water also gives life in a far broader sense.
								People need clean water and sanitation to sustain
								their health and maintain their dignity. But
								beyond the household water also sustains ecological
								systems and provides an input into the
								production systems that maintain livelihoods.
								Ultimately, human development is about
								the realization of potential. It is about what
								people can do and what they can become—their
								capabilities—and about the freedom they have
								to exercise real choices in their lives. Water pervades
								all aspects of human development. When
								people are denied access to clean water at home
								or when they lack access to water as a productive
								resource their choices and freedoms are
								constrained by ill health, poverty and vulnerability.
								Water gives life to everything, including
								human development and human freedom
